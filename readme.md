### 0.2 ###
* Leverage all of the new core Customizer API features that were developed in WordPress 4.1. 4.1 is required, and while we'll try to keep the plugin compatible with 4.1 for as long as possible, we may bump the requirement to 4.2-alpha eventually. Menu Customizer development was on hold while the 4.1 Customizer work happened; we'll pick things back up here now that the needed core APIs are mostly in place. If all goes well, depending on contributor interest and release timing, we may be able to propose Menu Customizer for core merge in WordPress 4.2.
* Adding new menus should work without a page refresh now.
* Menu item controls are rendered from JS templates now, both on init and when they're added dynamically. This should further improve performance and scalability, and is also generally awesome.
* While not particularly relevant given the other changes, compatibility fixes for WordPress 4.1 (including a fatal error) were also made.
* Props to @westonruter for making a couple of quick passes through the code and contributing patches to clean up the new JS implementation.

### 0.1 ###
* Extensive code cleanup.
* First pass at sub-menus, via the buttons in the "reorder" mode.
* Panel tweaks to sync with changes in WordPress core.
* End of GSoC coding period.

### 0.0.6 ###
* Implement live-previewing of menus and menu items.
* Use core templating functions in JS.
* Visual improvements to the add-menu-items panel, with scrolling contained within available-item-type sections. More to come here on the code side.
